    <body> The jack, also known as the Jack of all Trades. You are a reknowned craftsman, creating only top quality work. <br>
        You teleport into an open field, filled with tons of monsters and materials. What do you do?
<br> <br>
Hunt monsters for materials. <a href="fight.html">Get the loot.</a>
    <br><br>
Avoid the monsters and look for the materials to craft items. <a href="gather.html">Gather the materials.</a> 
        <br><br>
 Don't do anything because its scary and realize that you're not in the right place. Who becomes a crafter anyways? <br> <a href="afk.html">AFK</a>
