The short man is killed, as you call for help. Your shouts are heard, and the city guard rush to your aid. The cloaked man attacks the guards in an attempt to flee. The guards are killed, but more of them come. After a while they detain the assassin, and take him to the interrogation room. You are invited to come along, you...

Go with the guards to the interrogation room, maybe you can help them out. <a href="interrogate.html">Interrogate the assassin.</a>
