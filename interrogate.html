<body>
You sit in with the guards, and listen to the interrogation. The assassin refuses to talk. After what seems to be hours, he finally cracks. It is revealed that a group of terrorists were planning to blow up the city. The guards were immediately able to locate the bombs and disarm them. The police thank you for your cooperation. You become a famous investigator that saved the whole city. "All in a day's work."
<br><br>
A light appears and surrounds you, and you are teleported out and back into the comforts of your home.
<br><br>
You have won!
