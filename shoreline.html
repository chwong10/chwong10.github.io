When you arrive, there is a small group of people standing by a ship with a certain black flag and skulls. They welcome you with a loud "Ahoy Matey!!!!" They bring you to their ship with smiles on their faces.
<br><br>
The pirates accepted your presence, and over time you rose through the ranks to become captain. You lead expeditions across the world and gathered numerous treasures. 
<br><br>
A light appears and surround you, and you are teleported out and back into the comforts of your home.<br><br>
You have won!
