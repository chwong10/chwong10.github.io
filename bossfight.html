<body>
You enter the evil castle with your army, easily defeating the enemies that try to stop you. An enormous door stands in your way to the final chamber. The door is opens, revealing the Demon Lord in full armor, with his black longsword. Your men charge forward and engage the opponent. The sound of swords clashing rings throughout the room. Soon all of your men are defeated, but not before dealing heavy damage to the Demon Lord. You draw your simple blade, and charge forward.
<br><br>
A short clash of blades occurs, and the Demon Lord falls down, dead. 
<br><br>
Slowly, a light appears and surround you, and you are teleported out and back into the comforts of your home.
<br><br>
You have won!
