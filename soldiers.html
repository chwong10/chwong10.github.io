A random traveller trying to convince the village soldiers is quite hard, but with your passionate speech they soon become willing to help you in combat. <br>

    Now that you can lead a small army to battle, there is training to be done. Where will you go? <br><br>

The <a href="darkforest.html">Dark Forest,</a> filled with the creepy monsters of the night.
<br><br>
The <a href="openfield.html">Open Fields,</a> the starting zone for training. Filled with slimes and boars.
