Nobody is spared, and all targets are eliminated. The survivors feebly try to defend themselves, but the exhaustion forces them down. After you mercilessly slaughter them, you look at the results. Bodies are strewn across the land, and the survivors that were killed all seemed to wear dark cloaks with a cross sign. Under closer examination, they all were renowned assassins. They were trying to plan a revolution against the empire! But since all of them were killed, it can no longer happen.
<br><br>
A light slowly appears and surrounds you, and you are teleported out and back into the comforts of your home.
<br><br>
You have won!
