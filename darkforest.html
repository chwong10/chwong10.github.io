This place isn't called the dark forest for no reason. As you enter the forest, everything turns dark. There is only a slight laughing before the sounds blades swing. You turn around and all the soldiers are dead. When you look back again, a grim reaper is standing in front of you, laughing. Then the blade swings at you.
